        <h2></h2>

        <p>If you are even a little bit in love with philosophy, I know that you had your "What's the point of all
          this?" moment. And the standard existential answer is that there is no inherent meaning of life. This leaves
          us with a really weird question, If there is no real purpose of life then why am I living. We all keep going
          with our lives, many of use just sitting in the conveyor belt which keeps us moving and there is no real
          reason why are we living and that brings us the question "Why don't I kill myself"</p>

        <h3>Let me state the obvious</h3>
        <p>Now of course if you ever came to the conclusion that life does not have any meaning and you're still alive
          then of course there is something which stops you from killing yourself. Its not pain because most of us would
          still choose to live even if we are offered a painless death, it not our obligations as again if we are given
          option that all of our obligations will ba taken care of after we die, we will still choose to live. It's not
          merely the pursuit of pleasure that keeps us going. Most of life is not filled with peak experiences it's
          mundane, difficult, and sometimes painful and not the hope for pleasure as most of human beings know that they
          will keep going through the conveyor belt and life will be kind of similar. Saying "it's biology" answers how
          we are programmed to survive, but it doesn't answer the philosophical why we should choose to obey that
          programming</p>
        <p>I am not talking here about trading off a few years of your life for some kind of benifit after dying.
          Instead I am talking about killing yourself just because there is no 'inherent' reason you were born and for
          you to live. <strong>If I am let go of all my obligations and boundations and given all the pleasure I need,
            would I kill myself just for the reason that there is no 'inherent' meaning to my life</strong> and the
          rational reason for not killing yourself</p>

        <p>Now because we get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking, for a lot of us the
          question of suicide is stupid, they attribute one of the reasons stated above as the reason and go on with
          your lives. But for most of us the 'why' question arrives at some point and at that point camus says - </p>

        <blockquote>
          "The principle can be established that for a man who does not cheat, what he believes to be true must
          determine his action. Belief in the absurdity of existence must then dictate his conduct"
        </blockquote>

        <p>This mean that if you are not killing yourself then there must be something in back of your mind which is
          stopping you from killing yourself. You can put it all to 'survival instinct' but again if that were to
          provide a satisfying answer then this blog would end right here</p>


        <h2>The Awakening and Choices</h2>

        <p>Once we get this realizations we are left with three choices - </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1. Actually Killing Yourself</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>2. The Leap of Faith</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Acceptance and Revolt</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's discuss each one of these options</p>

        <h3>Option 1. Killing Yourself</h3>

        <p>Killing yourself through contemplation mean that you've recognized that there is really no reason to live.
          Mostly this is a kind of heartbreak, something close to a dream which broke. People who kill themselves are
          not born nihilists but actually they are the people who thought that life had some inherent meaning and thus
          was worth living and when they came to that purpose to live in the hour of need for support, they got nothing
          but a cold, silent, void. When they approached god they were not welcomed by a miracle but punished by a
          tragedy. Tragedy of truth</p>
        <p>But this doesn't end here, The jump from being heartbroken and in despair to taking the decision to kill
          yourself comes with a "rational explaination." This says because I have discovered that their is no inherent
          meaning in life thus my life is worthless and not worth living. Sucide at that point is only logical response
          to the problem, a way to resolve the unbearable contradiction between desire for meaning and the universe's
          silence</p>
        <p>The driver of this reasoning is suffering and despair caused by thinking "I want my life to have inherent
          meaning" and the implicit "If there is no inherent meaning in my life then I am impotent without a meaning."
          You have convinced yourself that the condition in which living life is worth something is that "life should
          have an inherent meaning" and the case of living your life without any inherent purpose don't even come to
          mind and the reason is that this whole reasoning is drawn from despair which says that you don't have any
          choice now </p>
        <p>When some people realize the thing which they thought gave purpose to their life is gone then they arrive at
          this reasoning and kill themselves. Others, who recoil from this step are presented to another, really
          tempting and comfortable path</p>

        <h3>Option 2. Leap of faith</h3>

        <p>This orignates from the inability of reason to fill the thirst for meaning, we all want the world to make
          sense, we all want something to explain what is happening with our life. Reason can't fill that void. Reason
          says that our deepest longing will never be satisfied. Reason is the real villain here, life was going great
          with meaning untill reason broke your dream and threw you into this painful world of void. And the second way
          to get out of this void is leap of faith. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of
          thinking is the path to justify this suffering and the feeling of inherent meaning is built into this "habit
          of living" and this habit entices us with the good old days with inherent meaning. </p>

        <p>Leap of faith is stop saying "I don't understand," and start saying, "I believe precisely because I cannot
          understand." Its choosing to believe in inherent meaning even if it defies logic just to get rid of pain and
          suffering which reason inflicts</p>

        <p>God is the being who makes the impossible possible. Reason tells us a dead person cannot live again, and that
          suffering can be meaningless. These are logical dead ends and painful realities to endure. The failure of
          reason is proof that we must look for a higher power. And one thing which we can all agree on is that reason
          is cold, dark and souless. An event which has happend can't unhappen, If you're dead then its over etc. </p>

        <p>In the wake of tragedy and crisis of meaning you can't go to reason. You can't tell someone whose loved one
          died that "everyone dies at some point", "its pointless to cry on something which was bound to happen." Reason
          is the prison, you cannot use reason to escape it and thus the way to get out is "leap of faith". Despair
          shuts down reason and screams "This is too painful, life is not livable without an inherent meaning, please
          give me something to believe in" which blocks any other way to live life than to submit to a faith</p>

        <p>In a way both suicide and leap of faith are pretty similar. Both involve getting heartbroken from the lack of
          an inherent meaning for life, both involve the getting rid of feeling of void and coldness which reason
          provides and both in a way convince you that without an inherent meaning life can't be lived. In case of
          suicide, the despair makes you believe that the only way left is to free yourself from the pain is suicide and
          leap of faith also makes you believe that you can't live without an inherent purpose for life and thus the
          only way to free yourself from the pain is to take a leap of faith and start believing that there is an
          inherent meaning of life</p>

        <p>This ends in a few ways, either you stick to that belief to pain and take the next instances of doubt as the
          "tests of faith" and clinging to belief everytime crisis of meaning arrives. Or your new meaning also fades
          off and realize that flocking between beliefs is futile and kill yourself to free yourself from despair or
          realize the third choice</p>

        <h3>Option 3. Acceptance and Revolt</h3>
        <p>What if when you get to realization instead of killing yourself or clinging back to religion you choose to
          suffer, you choose to endure this lack of inherent meaning of life and instead of getting rid of pain by
          killing yourself or by clinging to something which you don't even believe in, you start embracing this pain
          without any resentment. This means accepting that life craves meaning and universe don't provide you with one
          and getting on with it. Each day you choose rebellion, you choose not to kill yourself and rebellion becomes
          the central reason to live. This is not a one time decision but something which you choose to do over and over
          and over again.
        </p>
        <p>Bigger question is why choose this, it looks like this is the path with the most pain because you don't have
          the comfort of faith or "liberation" of suicide? And the answer is that you do it because there is no other
          way to go. You can't choose leap of faith and you can't choose death because both of them requires submission
          to fate, submission to pain and commit an act of weakness. The only pragmatic way is to change your relation
          with the hearbreak. Instead of something which is to be resisted or overcame now this pain is your constant
          companion. You are preserving your life and lucidity while acknowledging the meaninglessness of it all. This
          rebellion which stems through acception is what makes your life valuable and makes you superior to your fate
        </p>
        <p>Once you get to acceptance, the revolt not only becomes living your life without inherent meaning but also
          becoming independent of inherent reason. Once you stop longing for inherent reason to live your life, you gain
          the independence to get out of conveyor belt. Instead of filling that existential void with religion or
          entirely killing yourself, you can fill it with things in which you find meaningful. This is important because
          you are not forced to believe in something your intellect resents just for comfort, instead you choose this
          and now you have the independence to fill it with good things which makes your life better. If this finite
          life is all you have, the only logical response is to live it as intensely and fully as possible.</p>
        <p>To live your life fully you need your own morals and values. The way you judge your life should be by your
          own standards, this is enabled by the fact that there is no inherent meaning to life so
          you can create your own meaning your own values and morals. </p>

        <h3>What is Absurd</h3>
        <p>Camus believes that from their birth, humans live in a way that gives them an impression that there is an
          inherent meaning for life, it might be something which they implicitly start believing that gives meaning to
          their lives or it might be something which society imposes on them but we're really grown with the notion that
          something or someone gives them meaning in life. we really desire and try hard to believe that life has some
          inherent meaning but it does not. </p>

        <h2>Analyzing the three choices</h2>
        <p>Now Camus thinks that the </p>
        <h3>Freedom from pain or submission to despair</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>Here's the real kicker: Camus isn't telling us to be miserable because life is meaningless. Instead, he's
          suggesting that embracing the absurdity of life can make us happier. It's like finally admitting that your
          favorite reality TV show is completely ridiculous – and loving it even more because of that.</p>

        <h3>The Takeaway</h3>

        <p>So next time you're stuck in a seemingly meaningless situation (hello, compilation timez), remember Sisyphus.
          You might not be pushing a boulder up a hill, but you're engaged in your own absurd task. And maybe, just
          maybe, there's something liberating about that.</p>

        <p>The beauty of Camus' message isn't that he solves the meaning of life. It's that he suggests we can be happy
          without one. It's like realizing you can enjoy the party without knowing why it was thrown in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>Life might be meaningless, but that doesn't mean it can't be wonderful. And there's something kind of perfect
          about that.</p>
