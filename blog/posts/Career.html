        <p>We are the product of the decisions which we make. As children we don't have a lot of control over these
          decisions, we generally do what we are told by the elders to do. This changes as we grow older, as our brains
          grow and we start to able to think about the choices we make everyday with the self which in many profound
          ways is affected by the life we lived earlier. </p>
        <p>We have people who we love, who we are dependent on and who are our teachers, mentors, friends, enemies and
          other people who guide our lives by the time we are past teenage and with all the values, morals, expectations
          and "love" we take out of all these people. Most of us stand on the conveyor belt of these morals, principles
          and opinions and impulses and are sent to make decisions about our lives.</p>

        <p>On the surface we know what is a good life which is borrowed from the people around us but not a lot of us
          actually think a lot about what does it mean to live a good life, a moral life and a successful life and more
          importantly why to strive for all these things in life. We don't have the time or the bandwidth to think about
          it because we are already filled with the domestic problems and events which we begin to see in our lives and
          thus begins the conveyor belt.</p>

        <p> Because we don't think about what it means to live a good life we don't think about the actions which we
          should take in order to live a good life so what we do is that we start doing what feels right, what our mind
          after not a lot of contemplation tells us to do and sometimes, when things get a little bit serious we look up
          to the morals and values and the knowledge provided to us by the people who influence and then make a choice.

          to the morals and values and the knowledge provided to us by the people who influence and then make a choice.
        </p>
        <p>As we make more and more of these choices, we get more and more involved with the consequences which come
          with these choices and thus we get deeper and deeper in this <strong>matrix</strong> where our lives become
          more and more
          about the people around us and not around ourselves. As we go farther and farther down the conveyor belt the
          more we start to associate ourselves with what is around us and our lives become more and more about the
          values and the morals we gain along the conveyor belt.</p>
