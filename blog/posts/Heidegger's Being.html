        <p>Most people don't think about what does it mean to be a being untill they are introduced to philosophers and
          I was also one of those who took the question of being as something obvious and from one point of view it is
          obvious right? a being is someone who is alive and does something, at least this is how I would define it
          before reading Heidegger but after being introduced to this great philosopher I was aware of how much I think
          about the external world and how less on the being itself. As I've spent a lot of time wrestling with his
          thought, I've come to belive that this is a question which at least is worth of a thought because we can't
          truely understand the universe untill we understand ourselves and being in general </p>

        <h2>The Vertigo of Being</h2>

        <p>I was writing in my notebook, this ordinary object I use every day, when suddenly its sheer existence struck
          me with extraordinary force. Not its properties or its color, weight, or function but the sheer, overwhelming
          fact that it is. This experience, this vertigo of Being, is what Heidegger tried to recover from beneath
          centuries of philosophical abstraction.</p>

        <p>Now to a normal person it will sound as too poetic or just romanticism. We've become so accustomed to
          treating Being as self-evident that we've lost our capacity for astonishment at the simple fact that things
          are. In our rush to analyze, categorize, and control beings, we've forgotten to wonder about Being itself and
          I get it, its a question which takes a whole day of your time and in the end leave you with more questions and
          doubts and in the end you start questioning the basis of reality.</p>

        <p>This was addressed by Heidegger too; in the first paragraph of his book <em>Being and Time</em>, he said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "It (the Question of Being) sustained the avid research of Plato and Aristotle but from then on ceased to be
          heard as a thematic question of actual investigation."
        </blockquote>

        <p> Heidegger really encouraged people to think about the nature of their being and he even divinded daesein
          into 2 catagories -</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inauthentic Dasein</strong> which is basically which is lost in the crowd. Living life without
            much thought and just doing what one does. This being doesn't think about the nature of his being or
            anything</li>
          <li><strong>Authentic Dasein</strong> Is the being who confront his own being and the finiteness. It takes
            ownership of its possibilities and choose its own way of being</li>
        </ul>
        <p> What does he mean by finiteness? its the ultimate reality that we're all gonna die one day and we have
          finite time to live. Death is a funny thing, we generally take the fact that we all are gonna die really
          lightly. The truth is that we humans being squishhy pieces of meat have really fragile life and we can die
          really easily and still we take this so lightly. <strong>YOU, YES YOU THERE STARING AT THE SCREEN, ONE DAY YOU
            WILL BE DEAD AND IT WILL ALL BE OVER</strong> now of course, we can discover nano teachnology and recreate
          our brain atom by atom and basically live forever but the fact that if tomorrow you get hit by a truck, its
          really over</p>
        <p>Once you realize that time is limited, you're forced to make your own choices and basically make genuine
          choices rather than hopelessly passing your time in the grassland away</p>

        <h2>The Mirror of Dasein</h2>

        <p>Heidegger's main idea is captured in the term <strong>Dasein</strong>, which means "being there" Now its much
          more catchy in german and Heidegger had a weird fetish of creating new words possibly because there were not a
          lot of words which captured what he was trying to say but this might also be just a fetish</p>

        <p>Now many times I think about what life might be for a mosquito and the really stoic nature(Yes I know I am
          badly using the word stoic but that's the closest I could find a word to express that feel). Their existence
          don't mean anything for them, its just do all the things to survive and just fly your way off. Humans are
          really different in this way, we can think about existance and Heidegger says that we should think more about
          our existance. And if you think about it, we can feel our existance in a weird way. <strong>YOU, YES YOU RIGHT
            THERE, YOU EXIST, YOU CAN FEEL THINGS AND MOST OF YOUR BODILY MOVEMENT IS IN YOUR CONTROL</strong> just
          thinking like this is sooo weird to feel and I think humans are probably the only being on earth who can
          experience this</p>

        <p>Think about it right now, as you read these words, you're not just processing information. You're
          participating in a miracle of understanding, a moment where being itself becomes manifest through meaning, now
          this all might just be next token prediction and your understanding might just be pattern matching from all
          the input you have taken from your life from your senses but still the feeling of knowing things and
          understanding something is really unique and in a way weird. According to Heidegger this is what makes us
          unique not our rationality or consciousness, but our ability to be the site where Being shows up as
          meaningful.</p>

        <p>This is also where I disagree with heidegger, I feel that our ability to reason is what enables us to
          percieve the real word in a way that we can understand things. Its the reasoning which is enabling you to
          understand these words of english and not understand the words in a language which you don't know. I get the
          point that this is the not the only thing which enables us to be unique beings but I would say our ability to
          do this with much more intensity, with much more complexity, with much more inclusive approach and for much
          more time is what seperates us from animals who might reason but not at the same level as humans</p>
        <h2>The Hidden Depths of the Everyday</h2>

        <p>One of my most startling realizations about Heidegger's thought came while watching garba. The dancers don't
          approach the world as a collection of neutral objects waiting to be categorized. They're immediately immersed
          in a world of meaning; a cardboard box is already a spaceship, a stick already a sword. This isn't primitive
          thinking waiting to be corrected by adult rationality but it's a more primordial understanding of how we
          actually encounter being.</p>

        <p>I've started to see how this applies everywhere. When I write, my keyboard isn't first encountered as an
          object with certain properties. It withdraws into its function, participating in a whole web of meanings and
          purposes. This isn't just true for tools; it's true for everything we encounter. The world isn't a collection
          of neutral objects that we later imbue with meaning meaning is there from the start. Reasoning is the ability
          to percieve it as something which we understand and think about it deeply. For me, that primordial perception
          and reaction is just a less rigorous way to reason about the world</p>

        <h2>Time as the Horizon of Being</h2>

        <p>Perhaps my most radical insight into Heidegger's thought came during a period of loneliness. I realized that
          time isn't just a framework in which we exist; it's the very fabric of our being. When we're anxious, we're
          not just worried about future events but we're confronting the fundamental temporality of our existence.</p>

        <p>Think about any moment of your life. Aren't you always already ahead of yourself, planning, hoping, fearing?
          Yes there are moments in life when you are sitting in a peaceful moment with your girlfriend but even at that
          moment aren't you always carrying your past with you, not as baggage but as the very ground of who you are?
          And isn't the present always rich with meanings that come from both past and future? This temporal structure
          isn't something added to our existence; it is our existence and we are made by this structure.</p>

        <h2>The Technology of Being</h2>

        <p>Heidegger warned the world about technology. The real danger isn’t the machines themselves but it’s the
          mindset that reduces everything including ourselves to mere resources to be optimized. And to a point we are
          living in his nightmare, we’ve transformed social relationships into "networking," boiled education down to
          "skill acquisition," and turned nature into just another "resource." But atleast I think that unless we modify
          ourself biologically, in our nature there is this feeling to enjoy and truely experiance moments of life as
          is. When you're spending time with your loved ones, when you laugh out loud on a funny joke, when you are
          sitting alone in that chair, even when you are depressed I think you experience life without thinking about
          optimizing something or achieving something</p>

        <p>Heidegger think that this reductionist thinking is dangerous because it oversimplifies the beautifully
          complex nature of humanity and I agree with him. If we constantly shove people into rigid, dichotomous
          categories and ignore the rich nuances that make us who we are then we can't really experience the 'reality'
          of life fully (who knows what that means).</p>

        <p>I think that instead of thinking about teachnology as something which stifles the nature of beings which we
          are I think tchnology complements being. Think how artificial intelligence raised new questions about
          consciousness and Being, today, we can develop neural networks and see how they behave with some math. I
          wonder if we're not entering a new epoch in the history of being itself and this is the point. I think that if
          we try to 'save' something just because it represents some kind of 'true' meaning then we are denying the
          evolution into something which can lead to a better future. I think that we should aim to do things which
          elevate human beings and help us flourish instead of just thinking that past things represented something
          which is better and the best is now gone. I think the more exciting view of world is more about exploring how
          the world works and science is our tool for that</p>

        <p>Also a big part of Heidegger's thinking is this reasoning that humans are always bound to their beginnings
          and they should try </p>


        <h2>The Ethics of Being</h2>
        <p>Being comes with responsibility. Not just to ourselves or other people, but to being itself. Are you living
          your life to the fullest? If you die today right now would you know while dying that you lived a life "My Way"
          as Frank Sinatra said. Of course if you are not living that way then you will have the load of not living
          authentically for a chunk of your life but I think that we can overcome this by a little bit of amor fati(love
          of fate as told by Nietzsche) which means embracing your past instead of resenting it and thinking about it as
          an important section which built who you are today in all your good and bad</p>
        <p>Heidegger also believed that language is too much interpreted in a way which makes the complicated concepts
          of <strong>being</strong> and <strong>time</strong> way too 'obvious' and he thinks that the best way to
          express human emotion is using poetry instead of language. Now in the world where humans like me can be better
          poet this might be a good idea but the reality of the world is that there are twice as much bad poets as there
          are good poets. Though I agree that poetry have the potential to express emotions and semantics in a much more
          profound way than language. Maybe we should try experimental philosophy in poetry</p>
        <p>Heidegger believed in developing an approach to life that isn't only based on rules or consequences, but on
          letting beings be in their fullness. This involves a profound respect for the mystery of existence, a
          willingness to let things reveal themselves in their own way, and a resistance to the technological impulse to
          control, optimize, and simplify everything and of course we disagree on some of that.</p>

        <p>I think that just living life hoping to let things reveal themselves is in a way living inauthentically, we
          are beings and I think that its in our nature to poke our fingers into the unknown and figuring out the
          mysteries of things which are unknown and rejecting that just for the sake of 'letting things reveal
          themselves' is in a way rejecting that curiosity. The curiosity in humamns have given us science and whenever
          we try to make things 'appear to us naturally' we let others decide the unknowns after fumbling in darkness of
          unknown for some time and that kills the curiosity because now you have ready made answers to everything and
          you stop questioning which is fatal to human flourishing</p>
        <p>You can't live authentically if you just spend all your time stopping the innate desire to innovate and
          understand and to explore, waiting for things to reveal themselves. The 'most optimal way' to be authentic is
          to explore, create and question rather than to accept what is revealed to you.</p>


        <h2>The Future of Being</h2>
        <p>I see the danger Heidegger is pointing to, danger that we'll continue to forget being, that we'll lose
          ourselves entirely in the manipulation of beings, but I think that its human nature to care about our fellow
          human beings who we love. You can be a real objectivist inspired by Ayn Rand who does everything based on
          rational self interest and still find value and beauty in your loved ones and spend time with them when you
          are not keeping scorecard of how much value they provide you in life. The hope is that teachnology might lead
          to a new outlook to life, a new way of encountering being which is based on better understanding of universe.
        </p>
        <p>With technology, today we are living in the revolution, this is the era which will reveal a lot about the
          nature of reality and thus the nature of being itself and technology might be the best bet to know the nature
          of being better. As cold and pragmatic scientific method to understand the universe sound, its the best way
          for us humans to understand the universe and maybe beings too. Maybe in the end we will find out that we're
          not actually just meat and blood but this might be the most accurate way to find that out</p>
        <h2>A Personal Conclusion</h2>

        <p>I think that even if thinking about being can't provide us with great scientific insights about the nature of
          being, it can still help us a lot in finding out how we percieve life happening to us and see how we react to
          them. It makes us think about death and if we are living our lives or our life is living us. I would really
          recommend reading being and time and really questioning the question "What does it mean to be?"</p>
        <p>Of course, an integral part of Heidegger's legacy is his association with Nazi ideology. While we can attempt
          to separate his philosophy from his political views, it would be stupid to claim that those opinions played no
          role in shaping his ideas. Indeed, a significant element of his thought—such as the emphasis on being rooted
          in a particular place and its culture echoes his political ideology and may well derive from it which is
          despicable. Still one needs to accept that a lot of questions which he raised are really important to be
          discussed and thought about as they are really important to our understanding of being</p>
        <p>The question of being might seem abstract, but I've found it to be an important question. It touches
          everything we are and do. In asking about being, we're engaging in the fundamental task of human existence,
          which is letting reality show itself in its inexhaustible richness.</p>

        <p>As I write these final words, I'm aware that I haven't "explained" being. That wasn't my goal. Instead, I
          hope I've awakened in you what Heidegger called "the question worthiness of Being" the sense that beneath all
          our everyday concerns lies an endless mystery that's worth thinking about. For in the end, the question of
          being isn't just about understanding reality, it's about making our lives and decisions better, in openness to
          the wonder that anything is at all.</p>
