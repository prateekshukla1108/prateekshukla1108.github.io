<p>It’s been a year since I started living in social isolation. The only communication I have is the occasional small talk with my parents and one or two online friends. For most of my day, I am alone, hacking away at technology and diving deep into rabbit holes. One thing that happens when you’re alone is that you daydream and think a lot. This post is one of those thoughts that I captured.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Nostalgia</h2>

<p>I was going through my physics notes from about two years ago, and as I opened that notebook, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia for those old days when I was preparing for competitive exams. I noticed a stark contrast between my old and new self. A lot has changed from 2022 to 2025. It almost felt like I had stepped out of a matrix.</p>

<p>When you spend your entire day preparing for competitions, your world revolves around your teachers, peers, and a few outside distractions. Every day is tied to a circle of friends, shared jokes, and fleeting romances, where even the smallest interactions feel significant. Goals feel less like obligations and more like daydreams. The world isn’t yet sharpened into focus, and that blur is beautiful.</p>

<p>Looking back now, those hours felt like a wave of joy washing over everything else. The bonds we shared, the innocence of our jokes, the effortless sense of belonging—all of it shone with a kind of light you only notice after it’s gone. Sitting in that van was its own kind of ritual—one that ended the day not with exhaustion, but with fulfillment. Almost everyone has those kinds of memories in their life, and that’s the part of the matrix.</p>

<p>Everything was flowing smoothly until I found myself alone, gradually isolated from people and that sense of community about a year ago. The initial days were comforting, as I was able to dedicate more time to exploring new things in this new life—away from friends and all the comforts that came with it. After overcoming some initial distractions, I started working long hours. But as time passed, I began to realize something.</p>

<p>There are moments in life when we cross a threshold, and everything changes. We wake up, pull back the veil, and step into a different kind of awareness. Life outside the "Matrix" of mediocrity is thrilling yet unsettling. You find yourself alone, thinking deeply, and once you’ve awakened to a deeper understanding of yourself and the world, there’s no way back. The simplicity you once knew becomes unreachable.</p>

<p>This journey, though isolating and difficult at times, isn’t just about losing old comforts—it’s about forging a new reality. But first, let’s understand the transformation.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Living in the Matrix</h3>

<p>When you’re in the Matrix, life feels light and effortless. Your days revolve around fun, social connections, and the pursuit of simple pleasures and work. You rarely stop to question the bigger picture, and even if you do, those moments of doubt quickly dissolve into the flow of everyday distractions. This phase of life isn’t inherently bad; it’s naive, carefree, and human. The lack of heavy purpose can make life feel effortlessly beautiful.</p>

<p>But mediocrity is a kind of blissful ignorance. You don’t realize you’re living within constraints until something cracks open—a moment of disillusionment, a desire for more, or an encounter with ideas that reveal how limited your world really was.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Awakening: When the Matrix Falls Apart</h3>

<p>Waking up from the Matrix is gradual. It becomes painful when you revisit the past and realize that everything that once defined you no longer exists. Like Neo in the iconic movie, you’re confronted with the reality that the world as you’ve known it was a construct—a framework of beliefs, routines, and values designed to keep you comfortable but unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a gradual realization of your own potential, the death of a comforting belief system, or an intense yearning for a life of meaning and greatness.</p>

<p>You don’t notice it while you’re working, but then a call from a friend comes. They talk about colleges, relationships, and the latest viral trend, while you want to discuss CUDA kernels, deep learning, existential philosophy, or the hidden patterns in your code. You smile and nod, but a part of you screams, <em>Don’t you see? There’s so much more.</em> And you say to yourself, <em>Holy fuck! How did I come this far?</em></p>

<hr>

<h3>The Dilemma of Irreversibility</h3>

<p>Here’s the catch: once you step outside the Matrix, you can’t go back. Simpler times become unreachable because you’re no longer the same person. At this point, you have two choices: You may reminisce about carefree days spent fooling around with friends or basking in the naive happiness of old beliefs. If we cling to old times, we live in bad faith (denying the truth we’ve uncovered). Even if you try to recreate those moments, they feel hollow. You can’t trick yourself into forgetting the deeper truths you’ve uncovered. The price of growth is that you can never unsee what you’ve seen. But that’s not a bad thing—it’s just the nature of transformation. The other choice is revaluation: creating new, life-affirming values <em>beyond</em> old nostalgic memories.</p>

<p>You envy it. You envy the ones still asleep on trains, mouths slightly open, dreaming in the syntax of the herd. But envy curdles fast. Soon, you’re back in the caves, running experiments only you understand.</p>

<p>This awakening mirrors Nietzsche’s concept of the “death of God.” When old frameworks of meaning collapse, it’s liberating, but it also leaves behind a void. The comfort of simplicity is gone, and you’re faced with a daunting but exhilarating question: <em>What now?</em> This loneliness isn’t a flaw—it’s a symptom of growth. The Matrix thrives on conformity, but outside of it, your thoughts become too jagged, too specific, to fit neatly into small talk. You’ll crave connection, but not the kind that asks you to shrink. Over time, you’ll find your tribe: scattered across time zones, communicating in paragraphs instead of emojis, united not by geography but by a shared hunger to <em>see beyond</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Matrix: Layers of an Onion</h3>

<p>The Matrix isn’t a single phase of life—it’s a series of layers, like an onion that you peel away over time. Each layer represents a level of illusion or comfort you’ve outgrown. At first, it might be the realization that the goals you’ve been chasing aren’t truly your own. Then, it could be the dismantling of long-held beliefs about the world, relationships, or even yourself.</p>

<p>Peeling back these layers is rarely easy. Each one comes with its own mix of revelations and discomfort. You might find yourself mourning the simplicity of past layers while grappling with the new responsibilities and questions that come with each step forward. Each time you peel a layer, you ask your subconscious, <em>Can I release this? Can I step into the unknown without looking back?</em> But the beauty of this process is that with every layer you shed, you move closer to your authentic self. And another voice says, <em>We’re not done yet.</em> The onion may be endless, but every stage deepens your understanding of what it means to truly live.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Unanswerable Calculus</h3>

<p>In the end, you don’t “cope.” You metabolize. The chaos becomes fuel. The doubt becomes a compass. The loneliness becomes a collaborator.</p>

<p>You never stop asking <em>“How?”</em>—but the question mutates. It’s no longer <em>“How do I build a life?”</em> but <em>“How much truth can I stomach today?”</em></p>

<p>The answer’s always the same: <em>Just enough to keep the machine running. For now.</em></p>
